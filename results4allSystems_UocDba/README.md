sortingWRTareaUnderROC.txt: Table of system list sorted with respect to area under ROC

meanROC4eachSystemSetting.zip: ROC for each system tested. 

other png files: Grouped ROCs with respect to specific dimension tested. Example: eSyn500.png includes ROCs of all systems applying period synchronous segmentation. 128by16.png includes ROCs of all systems using feature size of 128*16 (time-frequency points).

All ROCs are obtained via averaging results of 5 random experiments
